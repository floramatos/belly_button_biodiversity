# Building User-Friendly Data Dashboards


## Overview
The main goal of the present project was to create a HTML page for volunteers to explore a dataset about the bacterias found in their belly button.

### Resources
Javascript, CSS, HTML, Github Pages

## Results
The HTML dashboard can be filtered by the volunteer’s ID and includes four parts.

The first part of the dashboard is the demographics panel. When a volunteer ID is chosen from the dropdown menu, that person's demographics information, such as location, sex, and age, is displayed.

The second part of the dashboard is a bar chart showing the 10 most frequent bacteria found in a person’s belly button. Some bacteria species are clumped together under the same OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) labels.

The third part of the dashboard is a gauge chart displaying the volunteer’s belly button washing frequency per week. Frequency can vary from 0 to 10.

The final part of the dashboard is a bubble chart displaying all the bacteria found in a person’s belly button.

## Summary
In sum, the dashboard created can help volunteers visualize the bacteria species found in their own belly button. Volunteers should be able to quickly use the dashboard to figure out whether they are eligible to sell their bacteria to companies looking for people who carry a specific number of a certain bacterial species.
